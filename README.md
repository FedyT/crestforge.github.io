# ⚔️ Crest Forge: War Within M+ Crest Calculator 🛡️

*(A screenshot of the Crest Forge application in action)*

## ✨ Overview

Welcome to **Crest Forge**, a simple, user-friendly web application designed to help World of Warcraft players efficiently plan their Mythic+ dungeon routes for crest acquisition in **The War Within** expansion.

As someone who might not spam M+ keys every day, I often found myself wondering: "How many runs do I *actually* need to upgrade that shiny new piece of gear?" This tool was built to answer exactly that, taking the guesswork out of crest farming\!

Just input your desired Gilded Crests and your comfortable maximum Mythic+ level, and Crest Forge will crunch the numbers for you.

## 🚀 Features

  * **📊 Gilded Crest Calculation:** Easily determine the exact number of Gilded Crests you need.
  * **🔢 Runed Crest Equivalent:** See the total Runed Crests equivalent for your Gilded Crest goal.
  * **⬆️ Max M+ Level Input:** Tailor calculations based on the highest Mythic+ key level you comfortably run.
  * **⛏️ Delve Integration:** Option to include or exclude Gilded Crests earned from Delves in your calculations.
  * **🛣️ Two Optimization Options:**
      * **Option 1: Focus Gilded (M+7+ Keys):** Prioritizes direct Gilded Crest drops from higher-level Mythic+ keys.
      * **Option 2: Focus Runed (M+2 to M+6 Keys for Conversion):** Optimizes for farming Runed Crests from lower keys and then converting them into Gilded Crests.
  * **🖥️ Responsive Design:** Works great on desktop and mobile devices.
  * **✨ Clean UI:** Intuitive interface to quickly get your plan.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1.  **Input Gilded Crests Needed:** Enter the total number of Gilded Crests required for your desired gear upgrades.
2.  **Select Max M+ Level:** Choose the highest Mythic+ dungeon level you are capable of consistently completing.
3.  **Toggle Delves (Optional):** Decide whether to factor in Gilded Crests obtained from Delves.
4.  **Click "Generate Plan":** The application will then display detailed tables for both optimization options, showing the number of runs needed for each relevant Mythic+ level.
